Note about the mongoose promise library
Section 27, Lecture 264
Hi Everyone,

In the last lecture Colt mentioned being able to limit how many documents you could remove by chaining .limit() 
onto the .remove() command in mongodb. However, that was a slight oversight and that specific syntax won't work. 
Please see here for an example of the correct syntax.

Meanwhile, in the next few lectures you will learn about an Object Document Modeling (ODM) package for Express called Mongoose.

You may run into two different warnings in your terminal regarding the deprecation of mpromise and open(), they will look like this:

Mongoose: mpromise (mongoose's default promise library) is deprecated, plug in your own promise library
instead: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html
and this:

`open()` is deprecated in mongoose >= 4.11.0, use `openUri()` instead, 
or set the `useMongoClient` option if using `connect()` or `createConnection()`
Neither of these warnings should happen anymore if you're using MongoDB 3.6.3 (latest version as of today) and Mongoose 5.0.11 (also the latest version) see here for instructions on how to update if you don't already have the latest versions of both MongoDB and Mongoose.

*Note: You may want to bookmark this lecture and come back to it if you run into either of the warnings mentioned above

cheers,
Ian
