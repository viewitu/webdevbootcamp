Note About Object References
Section 30, Lecture 284
Hi Everyone,

In the next lecture you'll be learning about Object References with MongoDB and Mongoose.

If you run into the following error while working through the lecture:

TypeError: Cannot read property 'posts' of null 

then see here for a solution.

Also, the output for referenced objects has changed in the latest versions of mongoose. Now, if there's only one referenced object in the array 
then you will see the entire object, but once 2 or more objects are referenced then you will see only their object id's (as Colt shows in the following lecture).
See here for more about this.

Thanks,
